# Life Expectancy Data Analysis

This project explores global life expectancy trends using a dataset from the World Health Organization. The analysis includes data cleaning, statistical exploration, correlation analysis, and visualizations using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Key factors affecting life expectancy such as GDP, education, immunization, mortality rates, and health expenditure are examined. The project helps in identifying the major health indicators that influence life expectancy across different countries.

The notebook includes data wrangling, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), correlation heatmaps, and insightful visualizations to draw conclusions about socio-economic and health-related factors. This project is a strong example of applying data science for public health insights.
